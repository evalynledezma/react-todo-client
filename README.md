# React Client For Todo App

> The app communicates with a python flask api that uses an sqlite database. You have the ability to create a todo, delete that todo and mark that todo complete.
> TODO:

- Create a Form for creating a todo
  - Take that data from the form and submit it to the flask api
    - `/api/create-todo`
- Render all todos
  - Get all todos from flask api
    - `/api/get-all-todos`
- Mark todo complete
  - Talk to flask api and mark done as `true` via `id`
    - `/api/edit-todo/<id>`
- Delete todo
  - Talk to flask api and delete by `id`
    - `/api/delete-todo/<id>`
